# Installing PuTTY
PuTTY is a free and open-source terminal emulator, serial console and network file transfer application. To make managing all the data files and databases easier. We use PuTTY for any software installations and for any server configurations. We will need to use PuTTY later on to [log onto the server to install Webmin](/Pages/Server/Webmin_Setup.html).

It is recommended to install PuTTY using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):
- In the command line of your computer:
