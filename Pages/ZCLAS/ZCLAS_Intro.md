# ZCLAS: Zambia Customary Land Administration Platform

[ZCLAS](http://13.244.91.45:8080/zclas/) is a land administration platform created by Alexander Solovov for the ILRG project. 

ZCLAS was developed to fill in the gap of missing customary land registration tool for using it in various chiefdoms. It was developed as a Web-application, using open source technologies to minimize licensing impact and reduce total cost of ownership (TCO) of the system. 

ZCLAS automates customary land rights registration and further transactions, providing a reliable tool to track and control registration process, making it clear and transparent. A number of business rules, developed in the system, help to avoid different errors and keep land right records comprehensive, consistent and up to date. ZCLAS is a multiuser system, providing strictly controlled user access to the system functions according to the role-based security policy.
