ODK Central is a server option for [ODK (Open Data Kit)](https://getodk.org/index.html). It stores forms and permissions and allows for the downloading of data collected from ODK. ODK is a mobile data collection platform, and allows for users to upload and enter data into forms both online and offline, it is accessible through ODK Collect, an application for android devices.
