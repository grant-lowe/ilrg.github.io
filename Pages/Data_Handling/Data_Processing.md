# Data Processing

Much of the data processing in the customary land documentation process occurs when cleaning and validating data in the update schema, and then moving it onto the public schema. However, the process is a bit different for images, compared to parcels. Tracking where data is in the process, and where something has gone wrong, or been missed, takes place in excel.
