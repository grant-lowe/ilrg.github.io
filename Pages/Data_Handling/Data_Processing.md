# Data Processing

Much of the data processing in ILRG's customary land documentation process, itself an adaptation of USAID's [MAST project](https://www.land-links.org/tool-resource/mapping-approaches-for-securing-tenure-mast-learning-platform/), occurs when cleaning and validating data in the update schema, and then moving it onto the public schema. However, the process is a bit different for images, compared to parcels. Tracking where data is in the process, and where something has gone wrong, or been missed, takes place in excel.
